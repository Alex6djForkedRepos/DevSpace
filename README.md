## Dev Space
Most developer tools can be clunky to use, needs a lot of ram or lacks basic features such as:
- Sentry - Requires a minimum of 6GB ram and microservice hell.
- Portainer - Very basic and confusing user access with features locked behind business that has a node/server limits.

Dev Space aims to have more complete features and functionality without sacrificing ram usage or usability.

Dev Space is a self-hostable dashboard that allows you to manage your linux servers, websites, projects and other developer tools.

It's free and open source to use with frequent updates on our Discord Server.

> [!WARNING]  
> This project is currently in beta but should be on-par with what Portainer offers and more.

### Install
Setup the website and database on a linux server with 1GB ram or more.

Then install the Agent service on your linux server which will remotely manage your server using a websocket communication to the website.
