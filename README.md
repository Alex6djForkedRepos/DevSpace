## Dev Space
Most developer tools can be clunky to use, needs a lot of ram or lacks basic features such as:
- Sentry - Requires a minimum of 6GB ram and microservice hell.
- Portainer - Very basic and confusing user access with features locked behind business that has limits.

Dev Space aims to have more complete features and functionality without sacrificing ram usage or usability.
