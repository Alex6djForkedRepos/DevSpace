## Dev Space
Most developer tools can be clunky to use, needs a lot of ram or lacks basic features such as.
- Sentry - Requires a minimum of 6GB ram and microservice hell.
- Portainer - Very basic and confusing user access with paid self-hosting licenses and node/server limits.

Dev Space is a self-hostable and easy to use dashboard that allows you to manage your linux servers, websites, projects and other services and is 100% free and open source!

This is written in C# using asp.net blazor and various other [frameworks, libs and tools](https://docs.fluxpoint.dev/devspace/credits).


> [!WARNING]  
> This project is currently in beta but should be on-par with what Portainer offers and more.

### How does this work?
This project uses .net 8 with asp.net blazor framework with SSR (server-side rendering) and MongoDB for the database.

The website will be self-hostable on any linux server.

You can then install the Agent service on your linux server which will remotely manage your server using a websocket communication to the dashboard.
