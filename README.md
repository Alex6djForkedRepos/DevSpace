## Dev Space
Most developer tools can be clunky to use, needs a lot of ram or lacks basic features such as.
- Sentry - Requires a minimum of 6GB ram with microservice hell
- Portainer - Very basic and confusing user access with paid self-hosting licenses

Dev Space is a self-hostable and easy to use dashboard that allows you to manage your VPS servers, websites, projects and other services and is 100% free and open source!

This is written in C# using asp.net blazor and various other frameworks, libs and tools which will be much better in terms of ram usage too.
