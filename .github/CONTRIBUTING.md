# Contributing

If you know C#, asp.net and blazor you are welcome to submit a pull request for any fixes, tweaks or new features.

Recommended to use visual studio 2022 to develop and also github workflows/actions/runners to ensure a successful build.

This project is still in beta so some pull requests could be denied or put on-hold for future use.
